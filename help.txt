    renmethod <class name> <method name> <return type> <new name>
    
        Renames an existing method in a class in the system. The class name and

    delparam <class_name> <method name> <return type> <param name>
    
        Deletes a parameter from a method in the system. The specified class
        name must have the method with the method type, and the param with the
